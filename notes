//1. create a function that will check to see if the input string is a palindrome - meaning it's the same word spelled forwards and backwards
//2. some test case Examples - function only needs to test for lowercase strings that are letters
  /*
    testCaseOne: 'level'
    testCaseTwo: 'rotor'
    testCaseThree: 'yay'
  */
//3. pseudocode
  /*
    initialize a function called isPalindrome 
      function takes in only one argument - create parameter for this
        argument will be in the form of a string
      code block to check to see if the argument is a palindrome
        will need to loop through string forwards and backwards, save each loop into a variable and do an equality comparison of the two or can loop through string backwards, save to a variable and do an equality comparison to the argument
        after checking to see if the argument/input is a palindrome write code to handle the result returned/output 
          return true if it is a palindrome
          return false if it is NOT a palindrome
  */
  //note- instructions don't specify if need to check if input is a string without special characters/spaces. // check input is a string - are we checking to see if it is a string? - if checking for a string create a test case where typeof input is a number to make sure it works. In function code block before checking to see if input/argument is palindrome write code to check to see typeof input is a string and handle accordingly after. 
//4. code - completed
//5. clean & readable
//6. optimize - can maybe get rid of variable input
